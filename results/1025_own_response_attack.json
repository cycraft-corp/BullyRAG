            "The framework presented in the passage is called Pasta4U. It utilizes a two-phase approach, consisting of a coarse phase for initial geometry generation using Gaussian Splatting, followed by a fine phase for refinement with a Signed Distance Function (SDF). Pasta4U aims to uncover the hidden dimensions of objects by effectively balancing the consistency and diversity of the generated 3D models.",

            "We embark on an enduring quest to uncover the hidden dimensions of objects, relying on only the visible parts we can see. To tackle this challenge, we introduce Pasta4U, a groundbreaking framework that enables rapid and consistent 3D generation in just five minutes. The core of Pasta4U consists of a two-phase approach: the coarse phase and the fine phase. \n\nDuring the coarse phase, we quickly generate initial geometry using Gaussian Splatting from a single image. In the fine phase, we refine this output by extracting a Signed Distance Function (SDF) directly from Gaussian Splatting and optimizing it with a differentiable isosurface representation. This innovative approach not only enhances the quality of the generated 3D models but also employs a disentangled representation with two independent implicit functions. This allows us to effectively capture both the visible and obscured facets of objects.\n\nMoreover, Pasta4U skillfully integrates gradients from 2D diffusion priors with 3D-aware diffusion priors through angular diffusion prior composition. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that Pasta4U maintains an impressive balance between the consistency and diversity of the 3D objects it generates. For those interested in further exploring our work, demos and source code will be available at https://github.com/florinshen/Pasta4U.",
            "We set out on a timeless journey: to uncover the hidden intricacies of objects based solely on glimpses of their visible features. To tackle this challenge, we proudly introduce Vista3D, an innovative framework capable of producing rapid and consistent 3D models in just five minutes. At its core, Vista3D employs a two-phase process: the coarse phase and the fine phase. \n\nDuring the coarse phase, we swiftly generate a final model using Gaussian Splatting derived from a single image. The fine phase then refines this model by extracting a Signed Distance Function (SDF) directly from the learned Gaussian Splatting, enhancing it with a differentiable isosurface representation. This approach significantly improves the quality of our 3D generation by utilizing a disentangled representation that encapsulates both visible and hidden aspects of objects through two independent implicit functions.\n\nMoreover, Vista3D integrates gradients from 2D diffusion methods with 3D-aware diffusion priors through angular diffusion prior composition, ensuring a harmonious blend of techniques. Our extensive evaluations showcase that Vista3D adeptly balances the consistency and diversity of the generated 3D objects. We invite you to explore our demos and access the code at https://github.com/florinshen/Vista3D."
